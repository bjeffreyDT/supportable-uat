		<h1>STORY 13. STAGES</h1>
		<h2> OBJECTIVE </h2>
		Advance a referral through the stages required for a service.
		<br><br><br>

		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS </h2>
		Using the controls in the referral overview, move a new referral all the way to the end of the intake process. You will not be able to admit them just yet, so for most services, the Queue stage is as far 
		as you'll be able to get. Remember, each stage has it's own set of criteria, but each stage requires it's checklist to be complete if there is one.

		<ol>
			<li> Navigate to Supportable with any web browser. Google Chrome is always the most optimal option. <a
					href="https://supportable-web-uat.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">Here is the link.</a> </li>
			<li> Use your credentials to enter your username and password. </li>
			<li> Read the <i>ISSUES/DESIGN FLAWS WE'RE ALREADY AWARE OF</i> section below. </li>
			<li> Open a referral that has made it past the "New" stage. You can also put in a new referral if you'd like to start from the very beginning. </li>
			<li> Click the <i>View Referral Details</i> button. </li>
			<li> Advance the referral through the stages that apply to the service. </li>
			<li> When you feel you've gathered enough impressions, fill out and submit the <a
					href="https://zfrmz.com/HX77s5TmRWM5qUkE2Iig" target="_blank">UAT Feedback Form</a>
				first by choosing <b>Story 12. Evaluation Tab</b> in the first dropdown. </li>
		</ol>
		<br><br><br>
		<h2> ISSUES/DESIGN NOTES WE'RE ALREADY AWARE OF </h2>
		<ol>
			<li> Currently, when you schedule an assessment, tour, etc., you can enter a future date, which is exactly what we want. Also, you will be able to mark
				the outcome of that assessment even though that date is in the future. This is not what we want. The fix has not yet been implemented. Eventually, you
				will not be able to mark the outcome of one of those events until the date is today or before. </li>
			<li> For the Queue stage, currently an approval is required for each scheduled date. We are looking into requiring only one approval for the referral. </li>
			<li> Links are not on-brand. They are currently blue but will match style of the rest of the application.</li>
			<li> The hover effect on buttons is not finalized but will be consistent across the application. </li>
			<li> For a completed tab, we will update the styling to stand out more. </li>
			<li> Currently date fields allow you to type in a date, but it will give you an error if you do. </li>
		</ol>
